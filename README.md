Pediatric Growth Measurement Tool
=================

Web-based for measuring child growth. This tool will generate percentiles (and standard deviations) and plot them against standard growth curves. Currently includes four standard indicators (as defined by the World Health Organization):

* Weight-for-age
* Body mass index-for-age (BMI-for-age)
* Length/height-for-age
* Weight-for-length

It's similar in functionality to the [WHO Anthro software](http://www.who.int/childgrowth/software/en/) and [WHO AnthroPlus software](http://www.who.int/growthref/tools/en/).

More to come.
